<h2>THE CASTLE OF AUGHNANURE,<br />
<br />
<span class="smaller">COUNTY OF GALWAY.</span></h2>

<p>Not many years since there was an extensive district in the
west of Ireland, which, except to those inhabiting it, was a
sort of terra incognita, or unknown region, to the people of
the British isles. It had no carriage roads, no inns or hotels,
no towns; and the only notion popularly formed of it was
that of an inhospitable desert&mdash;the refugium of malefactors
and Irish savages, who set all law at defiance, and into which
it would be an act of madness for any civilized man to venture.
This district was popularly called the Kingdom of
Connemara, a name applied to that great tract extending
from the town of Galway to the Killery harbour, bounded on
the east by the great lakes called Lough Corrib and Lough
Mask, and on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, and comprising
within it the baronies of Moycullen and Ballinahinch, and the
half barony of Ross. It is not an unknown region now. It
has two prosperous towns and several villages, good roads, and
comfortable hotels. &#8220;The Queen&#8217;s writ will run in it;&#8221; and
the inhabitants are remarkable for their intelligence, quietness,
honesty, hospitality, and many other good qualities; and
in the summer months it is the favourite resort of the artist,
antiquary, geologist, botanist, ornithologist, sportsman&mdash;in
short, of pleasure tourists of all descriptions, and from every
quarter of the British empire; for it is a district singularly
rich in its attractions to all those who look for health and
pleasure from a summer&#8217;s ramble, combined with excitable
occupation. Of its picturesque beauties much has already
been written. They have been sketched by the practised
hand of Inglis, and by the more graphic pencil of Cæsar
Otway; but its history and more important antiquities have
been as yet but little noticed, and, consequently, generally
passed by without attracting the attention or exciting any
interest in the mind of the traveller. We propose to ourselves
to supply this defect to some extent, and have consequently
chosen as the subject of our first illustration the ancient
castle, of which we have presented our readers with a
view, and which is the most picturesque, and, indeed, important
remain of antiquity within the district which we have described.</p>

<p>Journeying along the great road from Galway to Oughterard,
and at the distance of about two miles from the latter, the
attention of the traveller will most probably be attracted by a
beautiful little river, over which, on a natural bridge of limestone
rock, the road passes; and looking to the right, towards
the wide expanse of the waters of Lough Corrib, he will perceive
the grey tower or keep of an extensive castle, once the chief
seat or fortress of the O&#8217;Flaherties, the hereditary lords of
West Connaught, or Connemara. This castle is called the
Castle of Aughnanure, or, properly, <i>Achaidh-na-n-Jubhar</i>,
Acha-na-n-ure, or the field of the yews&mdash;an appellation derived
from the number of ancient trees of that description
which grew around it, but of which only a single tree now
survives. This vestige is, however, the most ancient and interesting
ruin of the locality. Its antiquity must be great indeed&mdash;more
than a thousand years; and, growing as it does
out of a huge ledge of limestone rock, and throwing its withered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>and nearly leafless branches in fantastic forms across
the little river which divides it from the castle, the picturesqueness
of its situation is such as the painter must look at
with feelings of admiration and delight. It has also its historical
legend to give it additional interest; and unfortunately
this legend, though quite in harmony with the lone and melancholy
features of the scene, is but too characteristic of the
unhappy social and political state of Ireland at the period to
which it relates&mdash;the most unfortunate period, as it may be
emphatically called, of Ireland&#8217;s history&mdash;that of the civil wars
in the middle of the seventeenth century. The principle, however,
which we propose to ourselves in the conducting of our
publication, will not permit us to give this legend a place in
its pages; it may be learned on the spot; and we have only
alluded to it here, in order to state that it is to the religious
veneration kept alive by this tradition that the yew tree of
Aughnanure owes its preservation from the fate which has
overtaken all its original companions.</p>

<p>The Castle of Aughnanure, though greatly dilapidated by
time, and probably still more so by the great hurricane of
last year, is still in sufficient preservation to convey to those
who may examine its ruins a vivid impression of the domestic
habits and peculiar household economy of an old Irish chief
of nearly the highest rank. His house, a strong and lofty
tower, stands in an ample court-yard, surrounded by outworks
perforated with shot-holes, and only accessible through
its drawbridge gateway-tower. The river, which conveyed
his boats to the adjacent lake, and supplied his table with the
luxuries of trout and salmon, washes the rock on which its
walls are raised, and forms a little harbour within them. Cellars,
bake-houses, and houses for the accommodation of his
numerous followers, are also to be seen; and an appendage
not usually found in connection with such fortresses also appears,
namely, a spacious banqueting-hall for the revels of
peaceful times, the ample windows of which exhibit a style of
architecture of no small elegance of design and execution.</p>

<p>We shall probably in some early number of our Journal
give a genealogical account of the noble family to whom this
castle belonged; but in the mean time it may be satisfactory
to the reader to give him an idea of the class of persons by
whom the chief was attended, and who occasionally required
accommodation in his mansion. They are thus enumerated
in an ancient manuscript preserved in the College Library:&mdash;O&#8217;Canavan,
his physician; Mac Gillegannan, chief of the
horse; O&#8217;Colgan, his standard-bearer; Mac Kinnon and
O&#8217;Mulavill, his brehons, or judges; the O&#8217;Duvans, his attendants
on ordinary visitings; Mac Gille-Kelly, his ollave in
genealogy and poetry; Mac Beolain, his keeper of the black
bell of St Patrick; O&#8217;Donnell, his master of revels; O&#8217;Kicherain
and O&#8217;Conlachtna, the keepers of his bees; O&#8217;Murgaile,
his chief steward, or collector of his revenues.</p>

<p>The date of the erection of this castle is not exactly known,
though it was originally inscribed on a stone over its entrance
gateway, which existed in the last century. From the style
of its architecture, however, it may be assigned with sufficient
certainty to the middle of the sixteenth century, with the
exception, perhaps, of the banqueting-hall, which appears to
be of a somewhat later age.</p>

<p>While the town of Galway was besieged in 1651 by the parliamentary
forces under the command of Sir Charles Coote,
the Castle of Aughnanure afforded protection to the Lord
Deputy the Marquess of Clanricarde, until the successes of his
adversaries forced him and many other nobles to seek safety
in the more distant wilds of Connemara. This event is thus
stated by the learned Roderick O&#8217;Flaherty in 1683:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anno 1651.&mdash;Among the many strange and rare vicissitudes
of our own present age, the Marquis of Clanricarde,
Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Earl of Castlehaven, and Earl
of Clancarty, driven out of the rest of Ireland, were entertained,
as they landed on the west shore of this lake for a
night&#8217;s lodging, under the mean roof of Mortough Boy Branhagh,
an honest farmer&#8217;s house, the same year wherein the
most potent monarch of Great Britain, our present sovereign,
bowed his imperial triple crown under the boughs of an oak
tree, where his life depended on the shade of the tree leaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are several of the official letters of the Marquis preserved
in his Memoirs, dated from Aughnanure, and written
during the stormy period of which we have made mention.</p>

<p>The Castle of Aughnanure has passed from the family to
whom it originally belonged; but the representative and the
chief of his name, Henry Parker O&#8217;Flaherty, Esq. of Lemonfield,
a descendant in the female line from the celebrated
Grania Waille, still possesses a good estate in its vicinity. P.</p>

<br />
<span class="smaller">NO. 1.&mdash;THE WASHERWOMAN.</span></h2>

<p class="center">BY MRS S. C. HALL.</p>

<p>The only regular washerwomen extant in England at this
present moment, are natives of the Emerald Isle.</p>

<p>We have&mdash;I pray you observe the distinction, gentle reader&mdash;laundresses
in abundance. But washerwomen!&mdash;all the
<i>washerwomen</i> are Irish.</p>

<p>The Irish Washerwoman promises to wash the muslin curtains
as white as a hound&#8217;s tooth, and as sweet as &#8220;new mown
hay;&#8221; and she tells the truth. But when she promises to
&#8220;get them up&#8221; as clear as a kitten&#8217;s eyes, she tells a story.
In nine cases out of ten, the Irish Washerwoman mars her own
admirable washing by a carelessness in the &#8220;getting up.&#8221;
She makes her starch in a hurry, though it requires the most
patient blending, the most incessant stirring, the most constant
boiling, and the cleanest of all skillets; and she will not
understand the superiority of powder over stone blue, but
snatches the blue-bag (originally compounded from the
&#8220;heel&#8221; or &#8220;toe&#8221; of a stocking) out of the half-broken tea-cup,
where it lay companioning a lump of yellow soap since
last wash&mdash;squeezes it into the starch (which, <i>perhaps</i>, she
has been heedless enough to stir with a dirty spoon), and then
there is no possibility of clear curtains, clear point, clear any
thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Biddy, these curtains were as white as snow before you
starched them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thrue for ye, ma&#8217;am dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are <i>blue</i> now, Biddy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Biddy, not all over&mdash;only <i>here</i> and <i>there</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, lave off, ma&#8217;am, honey, will ye?&mdash;&#8217;tisn&#8217;t that I mane;
but there&#8217;s a hole worked in the blue-rag, bad luck to it, and
more blue nor is wanting gets out; and the weary&#8217;s in the
starch, it got lumpy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It could not have got &#8216;lumpy&#8217; if it had been well
blended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was blended like butther; but I just left off stirring
one minute to look at the soldiers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Biddy, an English laundress would not &#8216;run after
the soldiers!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Such an observation is sure to offend Biddy&#8217;s propriety,
and she goes off in a &#8220;huff,&#8221; muttering that if they didn&#8217;t go
&#8220;<i>look</i> afther them, they&#8217;d <i>skulk</i> afther them; it&#8217;s the London
Blacks does the mischief, and the mistress <i>ought</i> to know that
herself. English laundresses indeed! they haven&#8217;t power in
their elbow to wash white.&#8221;</p>

<p>Biddy says all this, and more, for she is a stickler for the
honour of her country, and wonders that I should prefer <i>any</i>
thing English to <i>every</i> thing Irish. But the fact remains the
same.</p>

<p>The actual labour necessary at the wash-tub is far better
performed by the Irish than the English; but the order,
neatness, and exactness required in &#8220;the getting up,&#8221; is
better accomplished by the English than the Irish. This is
perfectly consistent with the national character of both
countries.</p>

<p>Biddy Mahony is without exception the most useful person
I know, and <i>she</i> knows it also; and yet it never makes her
presuming. It is not only as a washerwoman that her talent
shines forth: she gets through as much hard work as two
women, though, as she says herself, &#8220;the mistress always
finds fault with her <i>finishing touches</i>.&#8221; There she stands, a
fine-looking woman still, though not young; her large mouth
ever ready with its smile; her features expressive of shrewd
good humour; and her keen grey eyes alive and about, not
resting for a moment, and withal cunning, if not keen; the
borders of her cap are twice as deep as they need be, and
flap untidily about her face; she wears a coloured handkerchief
inside a dark blue spotted cotton gown, which wraps
loosely in front, where it is confined by the string of her
apron; her hands and wrists have a half-boiled appearance,
which it is painful to look at&mdash;not that she uses as much soda
as an English laundress, but she does not spare her personal
exertions, and rubs most unmercifully. One bitter frosty
day last winter, I saw Biddy standing near the laundry window,
stitching away with great industry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Biddy?&#8221; &#8220;Oh, never heed me,
ma&#8217;am, honey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Biddy, what a state your left wrist is in!&mdash;it is positively
bleeding; you have rubbed all the skin off.&#8221; &#8220;And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
ain&#8217;t I going to put a skin on it?&#8221; she said, smiling through
the tears which positive pain had drawn from her eyes, in
spite of her efforts to conceal them, and showing me a double
piece of wash leather which she was sewing together so
as to cover the torn flesh. Now, was not <i>that</i> heroism?
But Biddy <i>is</i> a heroine, without knowing it.</p>

<p>And in common with many others of her sex and country,
her heroism is of that patient, self-denying character which
&#8220;passeth show.&#8221; She is uniformly patient&mdash;can bear an extraordinary
quantity of abuse and unkindness, and knows
quite well that to a certain degree she is in an enemy&#8217;s
country. Half the bad opinion of the &#8220;low Irish,&#8221; as they
are often insultingly termed, arises from old national prejudices;
the other half is created by themselves, for many of
them are provokingly uproarious, and altogether heedless of
the manners and opinions of those among whom they live.
This is not the case with Biddy; she has a great deal of what
we are apt to call &#8220;cunning&#8221; in the poor, but which we genteelly
denominate &#8220;tact&#8221; in the rich. While you imagine she
is only pulling out the strings of her apron, she is all eye,
ear, and understanding; she is watchful as a cat; and if she
indulges in an <i>aside</i> jest, which sometimes never finds words,
on the peculiarities of her employers, there is nothing very
atrocious in the fact. Poor Biddy&#8217;s betters do the same, and
term it &#8220;badinage.&#8221; It is not always that we judge the
poor and rich by the same law.</p>

<p>With young servants the Irish Washerwoman is always a
favourite: she is cheerful, tosses a cup to read a fortune in
perfection, and not unfrequently, I am sorry to say, has half
of a dirty torn pack of cards in her pocket for the same purpose.
She sings at her work, and through the wreath of curling
steam that winds from the upraised skylight of the laundry,
comes some old time-honoured melody, that in an instant
brings the scenes and sounds of Ireland around us. She will
rend our hearts with the &#8220;Cruskeen laun,&#8221; or &#8220;Gramachree,&#8221;
and then strike into &#8220;Garryowen&#8221; or &#8220;St Patrick&#8217;s Day,&#8221;
with the ready transition of interest and feeling that belongs
only to her country.</p>

<p>Old English servants regard the Irish Washerwoman with
suspicion; they think she does too much for the money, that
she gives &#8220;Missus&#8221; a bad habit; and yet they are ready
enough to put their own &#8220;clothes&#8221; into the month&#8217;s wash, and
expect Biddy to &#8220;pass them through the tub;&#8221; a favour she is
too wise to refuse.</p>

<p>Happily for the <i>menage</i> of our English houses, the temptation
to thievery which must exist where, as in Dublin, servants
are allowed what is termed &#8220;breakfast money,&#8221; which
means that they are not to eat of their employers&#8217; bread, but
&#8220;find themselves,&#8221; and which restriction, all who understand
human nature know is the greatest possible inducement to
picking and stealing; happily, I say, English servants have
no temptation to steal the <i>necessaries</i> of life; they are fed
and treated as human beings; and consequently there is not a
tithe of the extravagance, the waste, the pilfering, which is
to be met with in Irish kitchens.</p>

<p>For all this I blame the system rather than the servant;
and it is quite odd how Biddy accommodates herself to every
modification of system in every house she goes to. The only
thing she cannot bear is to hear her country abused; even a
jest at its expense will send the blood mounting to her cheek;
and some years ago (for Biddy and I are old acquaintances)
I used to tease her most unmercifully on that head. There
is nothing elevates the Irish peasant so highly in my esteem
as his earnest love for his country when absent from it. Your
well-bred Irishman, in nine cases out of ten, looks disconcerted
when you allude to his country, and with either a
<i>brogue</i> or a <i>tone</i>, an oily, easy, musical swing of the voice,
which is never lost, begs to inquire &#8220;how you knew he was
Irish?&#8221; and has sometimes the audacity to remark, &#8220;that
people cannot help their misfortunes.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the peasant-born have none of this painful affectation.
Hear Biddy when challenged as to her country: the questioner
is a lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thrue for ye, madam, I am Irish, sure, and my people
before me, God be praised for it! I&#8217;d be long sorry to disgrace
my counthry, my lady. Fine men and women stays in
it and comes out of it, the more&#8217;s the pity&mdash;that last, I mane;
it&#8217;s well enough for the likes of me to lave it; I could do it no
good. But, as to the gentry, the <i>sod</i> keeps them, and <i>sure
they might keep on the sod</i>! Ye needn&#8217;t be afraid of me, my
lady; I scorn to disgrace my counthry; I&#8217;m not afraid of my
character, or work&mdash;it&#8217;s all I have to be proud of in the wide
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>How much more respect does this beget in every right-thinking
mind, than the mean attempt to conceal a fact of
which we all, as well as poor Biddy, have a right to be proud!
The greatest hero in the world was unfortunate, but he was
not less a hero; the most highly favoured country in the
world has been in the same predicament, but it is not less a
great country.</p>

<p>Biddy&#8217;s reply, however, to any one in an inferior grade of
society, is very different.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Irish?&mdash;to be sure I am. Do ye think I&#8217;m going to
deny my counthry, God bless it! Throth and it&#8217;s myself that
is, and proud of that same. Irish! what else would I be, I
wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Biddy! her life has been one long-drawn scene of
incessant, almost heart-rending labour. From the time she was
eight years old, she earned her own bread; and any, ignorant
of the wild spirit-springing outbursts of glee, that might
almost be termed &#8220;the Irish epidemic,&#8221; would wonder how it
was that Biddy retained her habitual cheerfulness, to say
nothing of the hearty laughter she indulges in of an evening,
and the Irish jig she treats the servants to at the kitchen
Christmas merry-making.</p>

<p>Last Christmas, indeed, Biddy was not so gay as usual.
Our pretty housemaid had for two or three years made it a
regular request that Biddy should put <i>her own</i> wedding ring
in the kitchen pudding&mdash;I do not know why, for Jessie never
had the luck to find it in her division. But so it was. A
merry night is Christmas eve in our cheerful English homes&mdash;The
cook puffed out with additional importance, weighing her
ingredients according to rule, for &#8220;a one-pound or two-pound
pudding;&#8221; surveying her larded turkey, and pronouncing
upon the relative merits of the sirloin which is to be
&#8220;roast for the parlour,&#8221; and &#8220;the ribs&#8221; that are destined
for the kitchen; although she has a great deal to do, like all
English cooks she is in a most sweet temper, because there
is a great deal to eat; and she exults over the &#8220;dozens&#8221; of
mince pies, the soup, the savoury fish, the huge bundles of
celery, and the rotund barrel of oysters, in a manner that
must be seen to be understood. The housemaid is equally
busy in <i>her</i> department. The groom smuggles in the mistletoe,
which the old butler slyly suspends from one of the bacon
hooks in the ceiling, and then kisses the cook beneath. The
green-grocer&#8217;s boy gets well rated for not bringing &#8220;red
berries on all the holly.&#8221; The evening is wound up with potations,
&#8220;pottle deep,&#8221; of ale and hot elderberry wine, and a
loud cheer echoes through the house when the clock strikes
twelve. Poor must the family be, who have not a few pounds
of meat, a few loaves of bread, and a few shillings, to distribute
amongst some old pensioners on Christmas eve.</p>

<p>In our small household, Biddy has been a positive necessary
for many Christmas days, and as many Christmas eves.
She was never told to come&mdash;it was an understood thing.
Biddy rang the gate bell every twenty-fourth of December,
at six o&#8217;clock, and even the English cook returned her national
salutation of &#8220;God save all here,&#8221; with cordiality.</p>

<p>Jessie, as I have said, is her great ally; I am sure she has
found her at least a score of husbands, <i>in the tea cups</i>, in as
many months.</p>

<p>The morning of last Christmas eve, however, Biddy came
not. Six o&#8217;clock, seven o&#8217;clock, eight o&#8217;clock, and the maids
were not up.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did they know the hour?&mdash;Biddy never rang.&#8221; The
house was in a state of commotion. The cook declaring,
bit by bit, &#8220;that she knew how it would <i>hend</i>!&mdash;it was
<i>halways</i> the way with them <i>Hirish</i>. Oh, dirty, ungrateful!&mdash;very
pretty! Who <i>was</i> to <i>eat</i> the copper, or boil
the <i>am</i>, or see after the <i>sallery</i>, or butter the tins, or <i>old</i>
the pudding cloth?&#8221;&mdash;while Jessie whimpered, &#8220;<i>or drop the
ring in the kitchen pudding</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of the clattering domestic bustle of old Christmas,
every one looked sulky, and, as usual when a household is
not astir in the early morning, every thing went wrong. I
got out of temper myself, and, resolved if possible never to
speak to a servant when angry, I put on my furs, and set
forth to see what had become of my poor industrious countrywoman.</p>

<p>She lived at the corner of Gore Lane!&mdash;the St Giles&#8217;s of our
respectable parish of Kensington; and when I entered her
little room&mdash;which, by the way, though never orderly, was
always clean&mdash;Biddy, who had been sitting over the embers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of the fire, instead of sending the beams of her countenance to
greet me, turned away, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>This was unexpected, and the ire which had in some
degree arisen at the disappointment that had disturbed the
house, vanished altogether. I forgot to say that Biddy had
been happily relieved from the blight of a drunken husband
about six years ago, and laboured to support three little
children without ever having entertained the remotest idea
of sending them to the parish.</p>

<p>She had &#8220;her families,&#8221; for whom she washed at their
own houses, and at over hours &#8220;took in&#8221; work at her small
cottage.</p>

<p>To assist in this, and also from motives of charity, she
employed a young girl distinguished by the name of Louisa,
whom she preserved from worse than death. This creature
she found <i>starving</i>; and although she brought fever amongst
her children, and her preserver lost much employment in consequence,
Biddy &#8220;saw her through the sickness, and, by the
goodness of Almighty God, would be nothing the worse or
the poorer for having befriended a motherless child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those who bestow from the treasures of their abundance,
deserve praise; but those who, like the poor Irish Washerwoman,
bestow half of their daily bread, and suffer the
needy to shelter beneath their roof, deserve blessings.</p>

<p>The cause of Biddy&#8217;s absence, and the cause of Biddy&#8217;s
tears, I will endeavour to repeat in her own words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I come home last night, as usual, more dead than alive,
until I got sitting down with the childre; for, having put two
or three potatoes, as usual, my lady, to heat, just on the bar,
I thought, tired as I was, I&#8217;d iron out the few small things
&#8216;Loo&#8217; had put in blue, particularly a clane cap and handkercher,
and the aprons for to-day, as yer honor likes to see
me nice; and the boy got a prize at school; for, let me do as
I would, I took care they should have the <i>edication</i> that makes
the poor rich. Well, I noticed that Loo&#8217;s hair was hanging
in ringlets down her face, and I says to her, &#8216;My honey,&#8217;
I says, &#8216;if Annie was you, and she&#8217;s my own, I&#8217;d make her
put up her hair plain; the way her Majesty wears it is good
enough, I should think, for such as you, Louisa;&#8217; and with that
she says, &#8216;It might do for Annie; but for her part, <i>her</i> mother
was a tradeswoman.&#8217; Well, I bit my tongue to hinder
myself from hurting her feelings by telling her <i>what</i> her mother
was, <i>for the blush of shame is the only one that misbecomes
a woman&#8217;s cheek</i>.</p>

<p>But I waited till our work was over, and, <i>picking her out
the two mealy potatoes</i>, and sharing, as I always did, my half
pint of beer with her, when I had it, I raisoned with her, as
I often did before; and looking to where my three sleeping
childre lay, little Jemmy&#8217;s cheek <i>blooming like a rose</i>, on his
prize book, which he took into bed with him, I called God to
witness, that though nature, like, would draw my heart more
to my own flesh and blood, yet I&#8217;d see to her as I would to
them.</p>

<p>She made me no answer, but put the potatoes aside, and
said, &#8216;Mother, go to bed.&#8217; I let her call me mother,&#8221; continued
Biddy, &#8220;it&#8217;s such a sweet sound, and hinders one, <i>when
one has it to call</i>, from feeling lonesome in the world; it&#8217;s the
shelter for many a breaking heart, and the home of many a
wild one; ould as I am, I miss my mother still! &#8216;Louisa,&#8217; I
says, &#8216;I&#8217;ve heard my own childre their prayers&mdash;kneel down,
a&#8217;lanna, there, and get over them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My throat&#8217;s so sore,&#8217; she says, &#8216;I can&#8217;t say &#8217;em out.
Don&#8217;t ye see I could not eat the potatoes?&#8217; This was about half
past twelve, and I had spoke to the po-lis to give me a
call at five. But when I woke, the grey of the morning was
in the room with me; and knowing where I ought to have
been, I hustled on my things, and hearing a po-lis below the
window (we know them by the steady tramp they have, as if
they&#8217;d rather go slow than fast), I says, &#8216;If you plaise, what&#8217;s
the clock, and why didn&#8217;t you call me?&#8217; &#8216;It&#8217;s half past
seven,&#8217; he says; &#8216;and sure the girl, when she went out at
half past five, said you war up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My God!&mdash;what girl?&#8217; I says, turning all over like a
<i>corpse</i>; and then I missed my bonnet and shawl, and saw my
box empty; she had even taken the book from under the
child&#8217;s cheek. But that wasn&#8217;t all. I&#8217;d have forgiven her for
the loss of the clothes, and the tears she forced from the eyes of
my innocent child; I&#8217;d forgive her for making my heart grow
oulder in half an hour, than it had grown in its whole life
before; <i>but my wedding ring</i>, ma&#8217;am!&mdash;her head had often
this shoulder for its pillow, and I&#8217;d throw this arm over her,
so. Oh, ma&#8217;am darlint, could you believe it?&mdash;she stole my
wedding ring aff my hand&mdash;the hand that had saved and
slaved for her! The ring! oh, many&#8217;s the tear I&#8217;ve shed on
it; and many a time, when I&#8217;ve been next to starving, and it has
glittered in my eyes, I&#8217;ve been tempted to part with it, but
I couldn&#8217;t. It had grown thin, <i>like myself</i>, with the hardship
of the world; and yet when I&#8217;d look at it twisting on my poor
wrinkled finger, I&#8217;d think of the times gone by, of him who
had put it on, and <i>would</i> have kept his promise but for the
temptation of drink, and what it lades to; and those times,
when throuble would be crushing me into the earth, I&#8217;d think
of what I heard onct&mdash;that a ring was a thing like etarnity,
having no beginning nor end; and I&#8217;d turn it, and turn it, and
turn it! and find comfort in <i>believing</i> that the little penance
here was nothing in comparison to that without a
beginning or an end that we war to go to hereafter&mdash;it
might be in heaven, or it might (God save us!) be in
the other place; and,&#8221; said poor Biddy, &#8220;I drew a dale
of consolation from <i>that</i>, and <i>she</i> knew it&mdash;she, the sarpint,
that I shared my children&#8217;s food with&mdash;<i>she</i> knew it, and,
while I slept <i>the heavy sleep of hard labour</i>, she had the
heart to rob me!&mdash;to rob me of the only treasure (barring
the childre) I had in the world! I&#8217;m a great sinner; I can&#8217;t
say, God forgive her; nor I can&#8217;t work; and it&#8217;s put me apast
doing my duty; and Jessie, the craythur, laid ever so much
store by it, on account of the little innocent charrums; and,
altogether, it&#8217;s the sorest Christmas day that ever came to
me. Oh, sure, I wouldn&#8217;t have that girl&#8217;s heart in my breast
for a goolden crown&mdash;the ingratitude of her bates the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>It really was a case of the most hardened ingratitude I
had ever known&mdash;the little wretch! to rob the only friend she
ever had, while sleeping in the very bed where she had been
tended, and tendered, and cared for, so unceasingly. &#8220;She
might take all I had in the world, if she had only left me
<i>that</i>&#8221; she repeated continually, while rocking herself backwards
and forwards over the fire, after the fashion of her
country; &#8220;the thrifle of money, the <i>rags</i>, and the child&#8217;s
book&mdash;all&mdash;and I&#8217;d have had a <i>clane breast</i>. I could forgive
her from my heart, but I can&#8217;t forgive her for taking my
ring&mdash;for taking my wedding ring!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was not all. The girl was traced and captured; and
the same day Biddy was told she must go to Queen-square
to identify the prisoner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;who never was in the place of the
law before, what can I say but that she tuck it?&#8221;</p>

<p>An Irish cause always creates a sensation in a police-office.
The magistrates smile at each other, the reporter cuts his
pencil and arranges his note-book, and the clerk covers the
lower part of his face with his hand, to conceal the expression
that plays around his mouth.</p>

<p>Biddy&#8217;s curtsey&mdash;a genuine Irish dip&mdash;and her opening
speech, which she commenced by wishing their honours &#8220;a
merry Christmas and plenty of them, and that they might
have the power of doing good to the end of their days, and
never meet with ingratitude for that same,&#8221; was the only
absurdity connected with her deposition.</p>

<p>When she saw the creature with whom her heart had
dwelt so long, in the custody of the police, she was completely
overcome, and intermingled her evidence with so many
entreaties that mercy should be shown the hardened delinquent,
that the magistrate was sensibly affected. Short as
was the time that had elapsed between Louisa&#8217;s elopement
and discovery, she had spent the money and pawned the
ring: and twenty hands at least were extended to the Irish
Washerwoman with money to redeem the pledge.</p>

<p>Poor Biddy had never been so rich before in all her life;
but that did not console her for the sentence passed upon her
protegé, and it was a long time before she was restored to
her usual spirits. She flagged and pined; and when the
spring began to advance a little, and the sun to shine, her
misery became quite troublesome, her continual wail being
&#8220;for the poor sinful craythur who was shut up among stone
walls, and would be sure to come out worse than she went in!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old cook lived to grow thoroughly ashamed of the
reproaches she cast on Biddy, and Jessie shows her off on all
occasions as a specimen of an Irish Washerwoman.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_IRISH_IN_1644" id="THE_IRISH_IN_1644"></a>THE IRISH IN 1644:<br />
<br />
<span class="smaller">AS DESCRIBED BY A FRENCHMAN OF THAT PERIOD.</span></h2>

<p>We are indebted to our talented countryman, Crofton
Croker, for the translation of the tour of a French traveller,
M. de la Boullaye Le Gouz, in Ireland in 1644. Its author
journeyed from Dublin to the principal cities and towns in
Ireland, and sketches what he saw in a very amusing manner.
The value of the publication, however, is greatly enhanced
by the interesting notes appended to it by Mr
Croker and some of his friends; and as the work is less
known in Ireland than it should be, we extract from it the
Frenchman&#8217;s sketch of the habits and customs of the Irish
people as they prevailed two centuries back, in the belief that
they will be acceptable to our readers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ireland, or Hibernia, has always been called the Island
of Saints, owing to the number of great men who have been
born there. The natives are known to the English under the
name of Iriche, to the French under that of Hibernois, which
they take from the Latin, or of Irois, from the English, or Irlandois
from the name of the island, because land signifies
ground. They call themselves Ayrenake, in their own language,
a tongue which you must learn by practice, because
they do not write it; they learn Latin in English characters,
with which characters they also write their own language;
and so I have seen a monk write, but in such a way as no one
but himself could read it.</p>

<p>Saint Patrick was the apostle of this island, who according
to the natives blessed the land, and gave his malediction to all
venomous things; and it cannot be denied that the earth
and the timber of Ireland, being transported, will contain
neither serpents, worms, spiders, nor rats, as one sees in the
west of England and in Scotland, where all particular persons
have their trunks and the boards of their floors of Irish
wood; and in all Ireland there is not to be found a serpent
or toad.</p>

<p>The Irish of the southern and eastern coasts follow the
customs of the English; those of the north, the Scotch. The
others are not very polished, and are called by the English
savages. The English colonists were of the English church,
and the Scotch were Calvinists, but at present they are all
Puritans. The native Irish are very good Catholics, though
knowing little of their religion; those of the Hebrides and of
the North acknowledge only Jesus and St Colombe [<i>Columkill</i>],
but their faith is great in the church of Rome. Before the
English revolution, when an Irish gentleman died, his Britannic
majesty became seised of the property and tutellage of
the children of the deceased, whom they usually brought up
in the English Protestant religion. Lord Insequin [<i>Inchiquin</i>]
was educated in this manner, to whom the Irish have
given the name of plague or pest of his country.</p>

<p>The Irish gentlemen eat a great deal of meat and butter,
and but little bread. They drink milk, and beer, into which
they put laurel leaves, and eat bread baked in the English
manner. The poor grind barley and peas between two
stones, and make it into bread, which they cook upon a small
iron table heated on a tripod; they put into it some oats, and
this bread, which in the form of cakes they call haraan, they
eat with great draughts of buttermilk. Their beer is very
good, and the eau de vie, which they call brandovin [<i>brandy</i>]
excellent. The butter, the beef, and the mutton, are better
than in England.</p>

<p>The towns are built in the English fashion, but the houses
in the country are in this manner:&mdash;Two stakes are fixed in
the ground, across which is a transverse pole to support two
rows of rafters on the two sides, which are covered with
leaves and straw. The cabins are of another fashion. There
are four walls the height of a man, supporting rafters over
which they thatch with straw and leaves. They are without
chimneys, and make the fire in the middle of the hut, which
greatly incommodes those who are not fond of smoke. The
castles or houses of the nobility consist of four walls extremely
high, thatched with straw; but, to tell the truth, they
are nothing but square towers without windows, or at least
having such small apertures as to give no more light than
there is in a prison. They have little furniture, and cover
their rooms with rushes, of which they make their beds in
summer, and of straw in winter. They put the rushes a foot
deep on their floors, and on their windows, and many of them
ornament the ceilings with branches.</p>

<p>They are fond of the harp, on which nearly all play, as
the English do on the fiddle, the French on the lute, the Italians
on the guitar, the Spaniards on the castanets, the
Scotch on the bagpipe, the Swiss on the fife, the Germans on
the trumpet, the Dutch on the tambourine, and the Turks
on the flageolet.</p>

<p>The Irish carry a scquine [<i>skein</i>] or Turkish dagger, which
they dart very adroitly at fifteen paces distance; and have this
advantage, that if they remain masters of the field of battle,
there remains no enemy; and if they are routed, they fly in
such a manner that it is impossible to catch them. I have
seen an Irishman with ease accomplish twenty-five leagues a
day. They march to battle with the bagpipes instead of fifes;
but they have few drums, and they use the musket and cannon
as we do. They are better soldiers abroad than at home.</p>

<p>The red-haired are considered the most handsome in Ireland.
The women have hanging breasts; and those who are
freckled, like a trout, are esteemed the most beautiful.</p>

<p>The trade of Ireland consists in salmon and herrings,
which they take in great numbers. You have one hundred
and twenty herrings for an English penny, equal to a carolus
of France, in the fishing time. They import wine and salt
from France, and sell there strong frize cloths at good prices.</p>

<p>The Irish are fond of strangers, and it costs little to travel
amongst them. When a traveller of good address enters
their houses with assurance, he has but to draw a box of
sinisine, or snuff, and offer it to them; then these people receive
him with admiration, and give him the best they have
to eat. They love the Spaniards as their brothers, the French
as their friends, the Italians as their allies, the Germans as
their relatives, the English and Scotch as their irreconcileable
enemies. I was surrounded on my journey from Kilkinik
[<i>Kilkenny</i>] to Cachel [<i>Cashel</i>] by a detachment of twenty
Irish soldiers; and when they learned I was a Frankard (it is
thus they call us), they did not molest me in the least, but
made me offers of service, seeing that I was neither Sazanach
[<i>Saxon</i>] nor English.</p>

<p>The Irish, whom the English call savages, have for their
head-dress a little blue bonnet, raised two fingers-breadth in
front, and behind covering their head and ears. Their
doublet has a long body and four skirts; and their breeches
are a pantaloon of white frize, which they call trousers. Their
shoes, which are pointed, they call brogues, with a single
sole. They often told me of a proverb in English, &#8216;Airische
brogues for Englich dogues&#8217; [<i>Irish brogues for English dogs</i>]
&#8216;the shoes of Ireland for the dogs of England,&#8217; meaning
that their shoes are worth more than the English.</p>

<p>For cloaks they have five or six yards of frize drawn round
the neck, the body, and over the head, and they never quit
this mantle, either in sleeping, working, or eating. The generality
of them have no shirts, and about as many lice as
hairs on their heads, which they kill before each other without
any ceremony.</p>

<p>The northern Irish have for their only dress a breeches, and
a covering for the back, without bonnets, shoes, or stockings.
The women of the north have a double rug, girded round
their middle and fastened to the throat. Those bordering
on Scotland have not more clothing. The girls of Ireland,
even those living in towns, have for their head-dress only
a ribbon, and if married, they have a napkin on the head in
the manner of the Egyptians. The body of their gowns
comes only to their breasts, and when they are engaged in
work, they gird their petticoat with their sash about the abdomen.
They wear a hat and mantle very large, of a brown
colour [<i>couleur minime</i>] of which the cape is of coarse woollen
frize, in the fashion of the women of Lower Normandy.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="WHIPS_FOR_A_PENNY" id="WHIPS_FOR_A_PENNY"></a>WHIPS FOR A PENNY.</h2>

<p class="center">BY MARTIN DOYLE.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whips for a Penny!&#8221; This cry attracted my attention;
I looked about, and saw a stout young man with a bundle of
children&#8217;s whips under his arm, standing on a flagway in Ludgate-street,
in the centre of a group of little boys, who if not
wealthy enough to buy from his stock, were at least unanimously
disposed to do so. The whips, considering the price,
were very neatly made, and cracked melodiously, as the man
took frequent opportunities of proving, for the cadences of
his almost continuously repeated cry &#8220;Whips for a penny,
whips for a penny!&#8221; were emphatically marked by a time-keeping
&#8220;crack, crack,&#8221; to the delight of the juvenile auditors.</p>

<p>Curious to ascertain if this person would meet such a demand
for these Lilliputian whips as would afford him the
means of living with reasonable comfort, I watched his movements
for nearly an hour, during which period he disposed of
five or six of them. One of the purchasers was a good-natured
looking woman, with a male child about two years old,
to whom she presented the admired object. The infant, with
instinctive perception of its proper use, grasped the handle
with his tiny fingers, and promptly commenced a smart but
not very effective course of flagellation on the bosom from
which he had derived his earlier aliment, to the infinite delight
of the doting mother. A fine boy, strutting about in
frock and trousers, was next introduced by his nurse to the
vender of thongs, and the first application of his lash was
made to an unfortunate little dog which had been separated
from his owner, and was at this time roaming about in solicitude
and terror, and probably with an empty stomach, when
Master Jack added a fresh pang to his miseries.</p>

<p>A hardier customer came next, and flourished his whip the
moment he bought it, at some weary and frightened lambs
which a butcher&#8217;s boy was urging forward through every
obstacle, with a bludgeon, towards their slaughter-house. A
half-starved kitten, which had ventured within the threshold
of a shop, where in piteous posture it seemed to crave protection
and a drop of milk, caught the quick eye of a fourth
urchin, just as he had untwisted his lash, and was immediately
started from its momentary place of refuge by the pursuing
imp. A fifth came up, a big, knowing-looking chap, about
twelve years old, who, after a slight and contemptuous examination
of them, loudly remarked to their owner, &#8220;Vy, these
ere vhips a&#8217;n&#8217;t no good to urt no vun&mdash;I&#8217;m blowed hif they his.&#8221;
You young tyrant! thought I to myself. I was moving off in
disgust, when a benevolent-looking gentleman came up and
was about to buy one for the happy, open-countenanced boy,
who called him uncle, when I took the liberty of putting
one of my forefingers to my nose, as the most ready but quiet
method of indicating my desire to prevent the completion
of his purpose. The gentleman took my hint at once, supposing
in all probability that there was some mystery in
the matter&mdash;perhaps that I wished to save him from the awkward
consequences of purchasing stolen goods, and walked
away. I followed him, and overtaking him, touched the rim
of my beaver, as nearly as I could imitate the London mode,
and at once said, &#8220;My dear sir, excuse me for obtruding my
advice upon you, but as <i>you</i> have the organ of benevolence
strongly developed, and your little nephew has already indication
of its future prominence, if duly exercised, I thought
it better that you should not put a whip into his hands, lest
his better feelings should be counter-influenced. Look there,&#8221;
continued I, as we reached the steep part of Holborn-hill,
&#8220;see that pair of miserable horses endeavouring to keep their
footing on the steep and slippery pavement; hear the constant
reverberations of the driver&#8217;s whip, which he applies so
unmercifully to keep them from falling, by the most forced
and unnatural efforts; see them straining every muscle to
drag along their burden, while they pant from pain, terror,
and exhaustion; look at the frequent welts on their poor
skins. Depend upon it, the fellow who drives had a penny
whip for his first plaything!&#8221; The gentleman looked rather
earnestly at me. &#8220;You are right, sir,&#8221; said he; &#8220;early initiation
in the modes of cruelty&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;The boy-child is taught to terrify any animal that comes
within his reach, as soon as he is able to do so; his parents,
sponsors, nurses, friends, are severally disposed to give him
for his first present a toy whip, and he soon acquires dexterity
in using it. Man, naturally overbearing and cruel, is
rendered infinitely more so by education. He first flogs his
wooden horse (the little boy pricked up his ears, and I hope
will retain the impression of what passed) and then his living
pony or donkey, as the case may be; he whips every thing
that crosses his way; and even at the little birds, which are
happily beyond the reach of his lash, he flings stones, or he
robs them of their young, for the mere satisfaction of rendering
them miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, sir,&#8221; said the gentleman, &#8220;and he becomes a sportsman
in course of time, and flogs his pointers, setters, and
hounds, for pursuing their instincts&mdash;he becomes their tyrant.
He goes to one of our universities, perhaps, and drives gigs,
tandems, and even stage-coaches, without knowing how to
handle the reins; he blunders, turns corners too sharply, pulls
the wrong rein, diverts the well-trained horses from their
proper course, which they would have critically pursued but
for his interference, nearly oversets the vehicle by his awkwardness,
and then, as if to persuade the lookers on that the
fault was not his, he belabours the poor brutes to the utmost
of his power; or it may be, lays on the thong merely for practice
until he is proficient enough to apply it <i>knowingly</i>. Are
the horses tired,&#8221; continued he, &#8220;worn out in service?&mdash;he
flogs to keep them alive, and makes a boast of his ingenuity in
forcing a jaded set to their journey&#8217;s end, by establishing a
&#8216;raw,&#8217; and torturing them there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Depend upon it,&#8221; said I, &#8220;such a chap had &#8216;whips for a
penny&#8217; when he was a child.&#8221; &#8220;Quite so,&#8221; said my companion;
&#8220;you have put this matter before me in a new point of view.&#8221;
Here we were startled by the familiar sound of the coach whip,
and saw a stage-driver flogging in the severest style four
heated, panting, and overpowered horses, coming in with a
heavily laden coach; the lash was perpetually laid on; even
the keenest at the draught were flogged, that they might pull
on the rest, and the less powerful were flogged to keep up with
them. The coachman, no doubt, when a child, had his share
of &#8216;whips for a penny.&#8217; When he grew up and entered upon
his vocation, he perhaps at first compassionated the horses
which he was obliged to force to their stages in a given time;
he might have had his favourites among them too, and yet
often and severely tested their powers of speed or endurance;
and at length, as they became diseased and stiff in the limbs,
and broken-winded from overwork, he may have satisfied himself
with the reflection, that the fault was not his, that his
employer ought to have given him a better team, and that it
was a shame for him to ask any coachman to drive such &#8220;rum
uns.&#8221; Habit renders him callous; he does not now <i>feel</i> for the
sufferings of the wretched animals he guides and punishes;
nay, he often coolly takes from the boot-box the short handled
<i>Tommy</i>, which is merely the well-grown and severer whip of
the species which his employer and himself had used in childhood,
when they both bought &#8220;whips for a penny,&#8221; and lays it
as heavily as his vigorous arm empowers him, on one of the
worn-out wheelers, which unhappily for themselves are within
range of its infliction. The hackney-coachmen and cabmen,
too,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Though oft I&#8217;ve heard good judges say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It costs them more for whips than hay,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are not much worse than their more consequential brethren
of the whip; all of them consider the noble creature, subjugated
by their power, and abused most criminally through
their cruelty, as a mere piece of machinery, to be flogged
along like a top as long as it can be kept going.</p>

<p>We reached the upper end of one of the numerous lanes
leading from the Thames; five splendid horses were endeavouring
to draw up a heavy waggon-load of coals; but as the
two first turned into the street at right angles to the others,
they were not aiding those behind them. Being stopped in their
progress for some time, by a crowd of coaches, chaises, cabs,
carts, and omnibuses, the labour of keeping the waggon on
the spot it had already attained, and which was steep and
slippery, rested upon the three hinder horses. At length the
team was put in motion, all the leading ones being useless in
succession as they turned to the angle of the street; and just
at the critical point, when the whole enormous draught rested
on the shaft horse, the waggoner, taxing its strength beyond
its capability, struck it with the whip. The noble brute made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
one desperate plunge to execute his tyrant&#8217;s will, and fell&mdash;dead
upon the pavement. &#8220;I think,&#8221; said my companion,
&#8220;that we have had a good lesson upon whips to-day; I should
prefer any other gift for my little boy here; for though it may
be urged that he, like the rest of his sex at the same age,
would merely make a noise with a whip, and would inflict no
serious pain, I am bound to bear in mind the actual fact, that
with the very sound of a whip is associated in the imagination
of all domesticated animals, the apprehension of pain; that
they are <i>terrorized</i> when they hear that sound, even through
a child&#8217;s hand, and I must therefore conclude that this symbol
of cruelty should not be his plaything.&#8221; I agreed with him
fully, and as our business lay in different directions, we parted
at Blackfriar&#8217;s Bridge, not, however, until my companion of
the hour had handed me his card of address. This was an
act of unexpected compliment which I could not return exactly
in the same way; I told him that I had never written my name
on a visiting card in my life, but that I was Martin Doyle,
at his service, and a contributor to the new <i>Irish Penny Journal</i>,
just started in Dublin. &#8220;Is not Dublin,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;in Ireland?&#8221; I stared. &#8220;I believe,&#8221; added he, &#8220;that Ireland
is a pretty place.&#8221; I wished the geographical gentleman
a rather hasty farewell.</p>

<p>As I walked on, I pondered on the many other instances in
which the whip is an instrument of terror or tyranny. First,
I thought of the Russian bride meekly offering a horsewhip
to her lord, as the token of her submission to the infliction of
his blows, whenever it might suit his temper to bestow such
proofs of tenderness upon her, and of the perpetual system of
flagellation, which, as we are told by travellers, is exercised
in the dominions of the great autocrat upon wives, children,
servants, and cattle. I thought of French postilions&mdash;flagellators
of the first order, at least as far as &#8220;cracking&#8221; without
intermission testifies; and, finally, of the British horse-racer.</p>

<p>Horses high in mettle, ardent in the course, without a stimulus
of any kind, struggle neck and neck for victory; they
approach the winning post; one jockey flogs more powerfully
than his compeers; the agonized horse, in his fearful
efforts, is lifted as it were from the ground, by two or three
desperate twinings (the stabbing at the sides is but a variety
of the torture) of the cutting whalebone round his flanks; and
at the critical instant, making a bound, as it were, to escape
from his half-flayed skin, throws his head forward in his
effort, half a yard beyond that of his rival, who has had his
share of torture too, and is declared the winner&mdash;of what?&mdash;a
gold-handled prize-whip, which is borne away in triumph
by the owner of the winning horse! To be sure, he pockets
some of that which is so truly designated &#8220;the root of all evil;&#8221;
but the acquisition of the whip is the distinguishing honour.</p>

<p>And how does this whip in reality differ from any of the
&#8220;whips for a penny?&#8221; It is of pure gold and whalebone; the
others are but of painted stick and the cheapest leather; yet
they are both but <i>playthings</i>&mdash;the one in the hand of a man who
has spent, it may be, half his patrimony, and as much of his time
in the endeavour to win it, while he attaches no real or intrinsic
value to it afterwards; the other in the hand of the child,
to whom it appears a real and substantial prize. The jockey-man
is not a whit more rational in this respect than the boy
who bestrides his hobby-horse, and flourishes his penny whip.</p>

<p>Then succeeded to my imagination a far more brutal scene,
the steeple-chase. A horse is overpowered in a deep and
heavy fallow; he is flogged to press him through it; he reaches
a break-neck wall; a desperate cut of the whip sends him
flying over it; again and again he puts forth his strength
and speed, and falls, and rises again at the instigation of the
whip. He comes to a brook; it is too wide for his failing
powers, and there is a rotten and precipitous bank at the
other side; he shudders, and recoils a moment, but a tremendous
lash, worse than the dread of drowning, and the goading
of the spur, force him in desperation to the leap; his hind
feet give way at the landing side; he falls backward; his spine
is broken, and at length a pistol bullet ends his miseries.</p>

<p>In a word, the donation of &#8220;whips for a penny&#8221; to any
child, fairly starts him on the first stage of cruelty; and if, from
peculiarity of temperament or the restraining influence of the
beneficent Creator (who, though he has allowed man to have
dominion, and has put under his feet all sheep and oxen, yea,
and the beasts of the field, has withheld from him the authority
to abuse his privilege), the child grows into the man who
is merciful to his beast, the merit is not due to the injudicious
person who first presents him with his mimic whip in
infancy.</p>

<h2><a name="ANCIENT_MUSIC_OF_IRELAND" id="ANCIENT_MUSIC_OF_IRELAND"></a>ANCIENT MUSIC OF IRELAND.</h2>

<p>A great and truly national work&mdash;the Ancient Music of Ireland&mdash;collected
and arranged for the piano-forte by Edward
Bunting, has just issued from the Dublin press; and whether
we consider its intrinsic merits, the beauty of its typography
and binding, or the liberal and enterprising spirit of
its publishers, they are all equally deserving of the highest
approbation. This is indeed a work of which Ireland may
feel truly proud, for, though in every respect Irish, we believe
nothing equal to it in its way has hitherto appeared in
the British empire, and we trust that all the parties concerned
in its production will receive the rewards to which
they are so justly entitled. To all lovers of national melody
this work will give the most intense pleasure; while by those
who think there is no melody so sweet and touching as that
of Ireland, it will be welcomed with feelings of delight which
no words could adequately express. It is a work which assuredly
will never die. To its venerable Editor, Ireland owes
a deep feeling of gratitude, as the zealous and enthusiastic
collector and preserver of her music in all its characteristic
beauty; for though our national poet, Moore, has contributed
by the peculiar charm of his verses to extend the fame
of our music over the civilised world, it should never be forgotten
that it is to Bunting that is due the merit of having
originally rescued from obscurity those touching strains of
melody, the effect of which, even upon the hearts of those
most indifferent to Irish interests generally, Moore has so
feelingly depicted in his well-known lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The stranger shall hear thy lament on his plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sighs of thy harp shall be sent o&#8217;er the deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thy masters themselves, as they rivet thy chains,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall pause at the song of their captive, and weep.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The merits of this work are, however, of a vastly higher
order than those of either of the former collections which
Mr Bunting gave to the world; for, while the melodies are
of equal beauty, they are arranged with such exquisite musical
feeling and skill as to enhance that beauty greatly; and
we do not hesitate to express our conviction that there is not
any musician living who could have harmonized them with
greater judgment or feeling. This volume contains above
one hundred and sixty melodies, and of these only a few
have been previously made known to the public. It also
contains an interesting preface, and a most valuable dissertation
on the ancient music of Ireland, in which its characteristic
peculiarities are admirably analysed; and on the method
of playing the Harp; the Musical Vocabulary of the old
Irish Harpers; a Treatise on the Antiquity of the Harp and
Bagpipe in Ireland by Samuel Ferguson, Esq., M.R.I.A.,
full of curious antiquarian lore, and in which is comprised an
account of the various efforts made to revive the Irish Harp;
a dissertation by Mr Petrie on the true age of the Harp,
popularly called the Harp of Brian Boru; and, lastly, anecdotes
of the most distinguished Irish Harpers of the last two
centuries, collected by the Editor himself. To these are
added, Remarks on the Antiquity and Authors of the Tunes
when ascertained, with copious indices, giving their original
Irish names, as well as the names and localities of the persons
from whom they were obtained. The work is illustrated
with numerous wood-cuts, as well as with copperplate engravings
of the ancient Irish Harp above alluded to. This
slight notice will, it is hoped, give our readers for the present
some idea of the value and importance of this delightful
work; but we shall return to it again and again, for we consider
it is no less than our duty to make its merits familiar
to our readers, as our music is a treasure of which all classes
of our countrymen should feel equally proud, and in the honour
of extending the celebrity of which they should all feel
equally desirous to participate. P.</p>

<h2><a name="TO_OUR_READERS" id="TO_OUR_READERS"></a>TO OUR READERS.</h2>

<p>The want of a cheap literary publication for the great body
of the people of this country, suited to their tastes and habits,
combining instruction with amusement, avoiding the exciting and
profitless discussion of political or polemical questions, and
placed within the reach of their humble means, has long been
matter of regret to those reflecting and benevolent minds who
are anxious for the advancement and civilization of Ireland&mdash;and
the reflection has been rather a humiliating one, that while
England and Scotland abound with such cheap publications&mdash;for
in London alone there are upwards of twenty weekly periodicals
sold at one penny each&mdash;Ireland, with a population so extensive,
and so strongly characterised by a thirst for knowledge,
has not even one work of this class. It is impossible to believe
that such an anomaly can have originated in any other
cause than the want of spirit and enterprise on the part of those
who ought to have the patriotism to endeavour to enlighten their
countrymen, and thereby elevate their condition, even although
the effort should be attended with risk, and trouble to themselves.</p>

<p>It may be objected that some of the cheap publications already
and for some years in existence, though in all respects fitted for
the introduction of the people, and enjoying such an extensive
circulation in the Sister Island as they justly deserve, have never
obtained that proportionate share of popularity here which
would indicate a conviction of their usefulness or excellence
on the part of the Irish people. But the obvious reply to this
objection is, that, undeniable as the merits of many of these publications
must be allowed to be, none of them were adapted to
the intellectual wants of a people, distinguished, as the Irish are,
by strong peculiarities of mind and temperament, as well as by
marked national predilections&mdash;and who, being more circumscribed
in their means than the inhabitants of the Sister Countries,
necessarily required a stimulus more powerful to excite
them. A work of a more amusing character, and more essentially
Irish, was therefore necessary; and such a work it is now
intended to offer to the Public.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Irish Penny Journal</span> will be in a great degree devoted
to subjects connected with the history, literature, antiquities,
and general condition of Ireland, but it will not be devoted
to such subjects exclusively; it will contain, in a fair proportion,
articles on home and foreign manufactures, information on the
arts and sciences, and useful knowledge generally.</p>

<p>All subjects tending in the remotest degree to irritate or offend
political or religious feelings will be rigidly abstained from, and
every endeavour will be made to diffuse Sentiments of benevolence
and mutual good-will through all classes of the community.</p>

<p>The matter will also be, to a considerable extent, original&mdash;and
to render it so, contributions will, be obtained from a great
number of the most eminent literary and scientific writers of
whom Ireland can boast.</p>

<p>A publication thus conducted, and, as may be confidently anticipated,
displaying merits of a very superior order, while it will
effect its primary object of conveying instruction to the people
generally, will at the same time, it is hoped, be found not undeserving
of the support of the higher and more educated
classes, while to the inhabitants of Great Britain it will be
found extremely interesting, as embodying a large amount of information
respecting Ireland, and the manners of her people as
they really exist, and not as they have been hitherto too frequently
misrepresented and caricatured.</p>

<p>To give to such a work a reasonable prospect of success, it is
indeed essential that it should be patronised by all classes; and
an appeal is therefore confidently made to the high-minded and
patriotic people of Ireland in its behalf, as without a very extensive
circulation it could not be given at so low a price as
would bring it within the reach of the poorer classes of the
country, whose limited means would preclude the possibility of
purchasing a dearer publication.</p>

<p>On their own parts, the Proprietors of the <span class="smcap">Irish Penny
Journal</span> have only to observe, that no efforts shall be spared
to render their Work deserving of general support; and that
as their expectations of immediate success are not extravagant,
they will not be deterred, by temporary discouragements in the
commencement of their undertaking, from persevering in their

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
